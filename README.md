# textEditor
textEditor like VS Code using LinkedList in Java.
<br>
Developed a Java-based text editor using a custom doubly linked list to achieve O(1) insertions, deletions, and cursor movements.
 Implemented core methods—Create, Write, Delete(k), and MoveCursor(k)—to allow seamless editing at any position 
without array overhead.
